This is GNU Bash, version 4.4.  Bash is the GNU Project's Bourne
Again SHell, a complete implementation of the POSIX shell spec,
but also with interactive command line editing, job control on
architectures that support it, csh-like features such as history
substitution and brace expansion, and a slew of other features. 
For more information on the features of Bash that are new to this
type of shell, see the file `doc/bashref.texi'.  There is also a
large Unix-style man page.  The man page is the definitive description
of the shell's features. 

-----------

here are some user-visible incompatibilities between this version
of Bash and previous widely-distributed versions, bash-4.2 and
bash-4.3.  For details, see the file COMPAT.  The NEWS file tersely
lists features that are new in this release.
